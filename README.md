## Self Reflection

Definitely made a lot more improvements in regards to developer workflow this project. For one, I made git commits much more often, so I'm finally starting to build that habit. Also, I'm getting more and more familiar with using the Chrome Developer tools, which I heavily relied on to locate and fix bugs that came up. 

As for the content of the project itself, it has certainly increased my familiarity with JavaScript functions, something I'm trying particularly hard to improve. 

Looking forward to eventually developing a full front-end for this project!
